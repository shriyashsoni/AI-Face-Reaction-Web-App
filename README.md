# AI Face Reaction Analyzer

## 📌 Overview
The **AI Face Reaction Analyzer** is a real-time web application that uses AI and face detection to analyze human facial expressions and determine emotions. It leverages **Face-API.js** (built on TensorFlow.js) to detect emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc.** through a webcam.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **AI Model**: Face-API.js (Pre-trained deep learning model)
- **Hosting**: Can be deployed on **Vercel, Render, or AWS**

## 💡 How It Works
1️⃣ The user **opens the web app** and allows webcam access.  
2️⃣ The **AI model detects faces** in real-time.  
3️⃣ The system **analyzes facial expressions** using deep learning.  
4️⃣ The **most dominant emotion** is displayed on the screen.
